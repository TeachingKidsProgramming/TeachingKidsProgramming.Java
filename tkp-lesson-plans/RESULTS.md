# TKP Impact

TKP was started in 2007 to give more students access to computer science skills.  In addition to being taught to 1000s of students around the world, the impact of TKP is best understood through individual stories.  Here are a just a few of those stories....

## Gen

I taught Gen to code via TKP Small Basic and later Java when she was 15.  She went on to teach TKP and also contributed to the building of the TKPJava library.  Gen gradudated with a degree in CS/Bioinformatics from McGill University.  Gen works as a senior software engineer at Doximity - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevieve-lesperance/).

## Brick

Brick's mom, Jessica Ellis, learned TKP Java and then taught it to Brick was he was 15.  Brick went on to teach TKPJava and also contributed to the building of their non-profit, TKPLabs, which trains TKP teachers world-wide.  Brick graduated with a degree in Math from BYU.  Brick works as a software engineer - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brick-e-4bba8a132/).

## Ian

My daughter, Samantha Langit, taught Ian TKP Java when we was 17.  Ian will graduate with a degree in CS/EE from Standford this spring.  Ian is the CTO of a climate action startup -[link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-arko/)

## Lexina

I taught Lexie and her sister Linus to code when they were 14 and 16.  They went on to start a Digigirl club in their high school and taught TKPJava each week for a year to a group of students.  Lexina graduated with a degree in Medicine from University of Zambia.  Lexina is a medical doctor -[link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexina-zulu-0a796628/)

## Alex

8th grade math teacher, David Coopersmith started a STEM program in his middle school using TKP Java.  David taught Alex TKPJava when he was in his 8th grade course. Alex was recently awarded a full scholarship to study Computer Science at UC Riverside.
