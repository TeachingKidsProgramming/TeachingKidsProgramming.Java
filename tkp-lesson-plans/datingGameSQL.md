#### Teaching Tips
1) PAIR the students, 2 per machine, one types and the other directs, switch roles after each query
2) SUGGEST that the pairs use the CHEAT SHEET first, you will be surprised that motivated girls will figure out how to ask the questions they are interested in using T-SQL
3) REVIEW new concepts BEFORE and AFTER the girls have used them, i.e. Aggregates.
