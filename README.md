## To Install ##

1) Open your C: drive, Create a folder called 'TKPSource' (Do NOT put any blank spaces in the folder name).

Download the zip file by clicking the 'Download ZIP' button on the middle right side of this page (for your convenience we also copied that same link directly below this line)

[![download zip button][2]][1]
 
After the download completes, then right click the downloaded file and then click on 'extract all'(Win) or 'unzip'(Mac) to unzip it.  

For Windows -- Next open the upzipped folders and find the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file.  Double-click the 'TKP_Launcher.jar file to run it.

For Mac -- download Eclipse and also download the Java SDK, then follow the instructions below.

2) After the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' runs successfully, then Eclipse should open with the TKP courseware loaded. The courseware is a series of *.java files.  If the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file displays an error, read the error and see the section at the bottom of this page to complete the steps needed.

A successful install should look like this (our sample has two lines of code completed 'Tortoise.show();' which can you run to test to make sure everything is working if you like: ![screenshot of Eclipse](http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen-shot-TKP-Java1.png)

## To Run and Use the Courseware ##

Double click the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file.  This will open Eclipse and load the TKP workspace (courseware) into the customized IDE (Eclipse editor) using the latest version of the TKP courseware.

## Lesson Plans ##

### If Standard Install Doesn't Work ###

If the standard install doesn't work, then there are a couple of possible reasons: 
   
   a) Java (6 or higher) not installed -> (Win) run the 'Ninite JDK Installer'.  After the installer finishes, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.
   
   b1) Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) not installed -> (Win) run the 'Ninite Eclipse Installer'. After the installer finishes, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.
   
   b2) Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) not installed -> (Mac) install Eclipse manually.  Be sure to unzip Eclipse into your applications folder. After you are done installing Eclipse, then double-click on the 'TKP_Launcher.jar' file to re-run it.

   c1a) Some old version of Eclipse installed -> (Win/Mac) Delete the version of Eclipse you have on your system by finding the folder named Eclipse and deleting it.  Then install Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler).  You can find Eclipse Kepler here

[Eclipse 4.3](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-43/keplerr)  

   c1b) Open Eclipse and point it at the this directory, by going to File>Switch Workspace>Open 

\TeachingKidsProgramming.Java

When done your dir should include

   `.git  
   .metadata  
   TeachingKidsProgramming`
